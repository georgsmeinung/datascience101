Data Science basic tutorials with Python Jupyter Netbooks

A **Learning path to Data Science** (DS) by using Python, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colaboratory asuming you don't even know how to program:
- Introducction to DS: [A Primer on Getting Started with Data Science for Beginners](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/11/a-primer-on-getting-started-with-data-science-for-beginners/)
- More detailed DS concepts here: [A Data Science Primer: Basic Concepts for Beginners](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-science-primer-basic-concepts-beginners-matthew-mayo/)
- Basic no-install Python tutorial to learn its syntax working directly on the site: [LearnPython.org interactive Python tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/) 
- More advanced Python Tutorial: [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- I do recommedn using Visual Studio Code as Python Programming Environment: [Getting Started with Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)
- And the use Visual Studio Code to explore the DS side of Python: [Data Science in VS Code tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-science-tutorial)
- This is free more advanced bookon Python and DS, you should know Python in order to read it: [Python Data Science Handbook}(https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
- In order to get directly to DS with no installation Google created Colaboratory that allows using Jupyter notebooks directly on your Web browser: [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
